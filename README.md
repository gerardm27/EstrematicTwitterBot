# EstrematicTwitterBot
WIP Twitter Bot made by myself as a joke for a couple of friends. 

Its main purpose is to answer to mentions by flipping by syllables the words in the tweet thus making it sound quite funny.
For now, the code made is working according to syllables rules in Spanish/Catalan. Not yet working for English words.
