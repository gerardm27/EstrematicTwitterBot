# EstrematicTwitterBot
WIP Twitter Bot made by myself as a joke for a couple of friends. 

Its main purpose is to reply to mentions by flipping the syllables in the words in a tweet thus making it sound quite funny.
For now, the code made is working according to syllables rules in Spanish/Catalan. Not yet working for English words.
